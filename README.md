## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

- Got a lot more comfortable working with .svg files by importing them directly as react components. Understood the difference between viewPort and viewBox and used this concept to appropriately resize the .svg logo without clipping any part of it.

### To know further

- After importing .svg file as a React component, how am I able to pass attributes which is possible in a React element? Probably the answer could be that the attributes are passed as props itself but .svg is imported in such a way that the props are used to define the corresponding attributes with the provided value under the hood.

### Useful resources
